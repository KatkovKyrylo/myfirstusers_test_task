This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

[DEMO-LINK](https://myfirstusers-test-task.vercel.app/)

Implemented: 
- Dynamic, optional, intercepted routes
- Added reading of a file with blog posts to display them
- Local "Add new post" feature (created a Route Handler for this)
- Divided code into separate components
